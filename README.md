# About the Software
RoXtra is a QM-Software which stores a lot of files in its "Prozessmodul".
In a big organisation such as a Hospital there are many redundant files created without any supervision.
One Solution which does not involve any of those funky AIs is using the name and the info tags in the Metadescription of the file. This is used to compare it to other files and use it as a fast and somewhat reliable way to detect copies or similar files.

The [Githubpage](https://github.com/roXtra/PublicAPI) from the Roxtra Gmbh for use of their API is using 
[httpYac](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=anweber.vscode-httpyac) and 
[httpBook](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=anweber.httpbook).
Those two tools are not very usefull or handy for creating loops etc.
That is why i decided to use Javascript and Nodejs as Satan intended.

# Using my Project as a template
Many functions are in their own js files for readability.
